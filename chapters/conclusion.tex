Although this initial application of the R3C system is to aviation/space vehicle cockpits, any sufficiently complex human-system interface could be designed with this system, such as telerobotics, air traffic control, robotic surgery, etc.
The technology that supports our proof of concept system is rapidly improving, and further iterations of our technology integration will provide higher fidelity and an easier user experience.
