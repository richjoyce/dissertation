<p class="site-intro">
This site lists the latest automatic builds of my dissertation. Most likely you want to read the <a href="assets/draft-latest.pdf">latest stable draft</a>.
</p>

<p class="site-intro">
Full versions are built to submission format guidelines, while draft is double spaced and leaves room for comments in margin and is more focused on content.
</p>

<p class="site-intro">
Stable versions are relatively readable, usually tagged after I complete a section.
