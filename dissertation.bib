	abstract = {According to Fitts' law, human movement can be modeled by analogy to the transmission of information. Fitts' popular model has been widely adopted in numerous research areas, including kinematics, human factors, and (recently) human-computer interaction (HCI). The present study provides a historical and theoretical context for the model, including an analysis of problems that have emerged through the systematic deviation of observations from predictions. Refinements to the model are described, including a formulation for the index of task difficulty that is claimed to be more theoretically sound than Fitts' original formulation. The model's utility in predicting the time to position a cursor and select a target is explored through a review of six Fitts' law studies employing devices such as the mouse, trackball, joystick, touchpad, helmet-mounted sight, and eye tracker. An analysis of the performance measures reveals tremendous inconsistencies, making across-study comparisons difficult. Sources of experimental variation are identified to reconcile these differences.},

	abstract = {A number of recent models of limb control have attempted to explain speed-accuracy trade-off in goal-directed movements on the basis of the characteristics of the muscular impulses that are specified prior to movement initiation. In contrast, studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that, even for very rapid aiming movements, the characteristics of the movement trajectory change with the availability of visual information about the position of the limb and the target during the movement. Moreover, when the movement of the limb is perturbed at movement initiation by an electromagnetic force, performers can rapidly adjust their aiming movements in order to hit the target if visual feedback is available. The performer can also rapidly adjust to unexpected changes in target size and amplitude. Visually based adjustments to the movement trajectory can be either discrete or continuous.PsycINFO classification: 2330; 2343},

Aiming movements with the same index of difficulty and MT may have different planning and control processes depending on the specific combination of movement amplitude and target size. Trajectories were evaluated for a broad range of amplitudes and target sizes. A three-dimensional motion recording system (WATSMART) monitored the position of a stylus during aiming movements. MT results replicated Fitts' Law. Analysis of the resultant velocity profiles indicated the following significant effects: As amplitude of movement increased, so did the time to peak resultant velocity; peak resultant velocity increased slightly with target size, and to a greater extent with increases in the amplitude of movement; the time after peak resultant velocity was a function of both amplitude and target size. Resultant velocity profiles were normalized in the time domain to look for scalar relation in the trajectory shape. This revealed that: the resultant velocity profiles were not symmetrical; the proportion of time spent prior to and after peak speed was sensitive to target size only, i.e. as target size decreased, the profiles became more skewed to the right, indicating a longer decelerative phase; for a given target size, a family of curves might be defined and scaled on movement amplitude. These results suggest that a generalized program (base trajectory representation) exists for a given target width and is parameterized or scaled according to the amplitude of movement.},

Results show that co-location is an important factor, and when coupled with haptic feedback the performance of the user is greatly improved.},

	abstract = {This book contains information about methods for measuring subjective somatic symptoms. The main focus is on the presentation of 2 scaling methods: the Borg RPE scale and the Borg CR10 scale. The Borg RPE scale is a scale for ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). It is a tool for estimating effort and exertion, breathlessness, and fatigue during physical work. The Borg CR10 scale is a category-ratio (CR) scale anchored at the number 10, which represents extreme intensities. It is a general intensity scale for most subjective magnitudes that with special anchors can be used to measure exertion and pain. A basic foundation for this book is the acceptance of a human as a psychosomatic whole. This means that psychological factors, such as personality, psychosocial factors, fear, and anxiety, affect somatic responses. It also means, however, that somatic functioning and signs of diseases can be studied psychologically, using human perception as a diagnostic instrument. This book deals primarily with the latter aspect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

To assess which subjective scale, the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Borg CR10 (Borg) scale, or the Likert scale (LS), if any, is decidedly more reproducible and sensitive to change in the assessment of symptoms.
Design
Prospective clinical study.
Setting
Exercise laboratory.
Participants
Twenty-three physically active male subjects (mean ± SD age of 30 ± 4 years old) were recruited.
Intervention
Each subject attended the exercise laboratory on four occasions at intervals of 1 week. Three subjective scales were used: (1) the VAS (continuous scale); (2) the Borg scale (12 fixed points); and (3) the Likert scale (LS; 5 fixed points). Four identical submaximal tests were given (2 min at 60\% maximum oxygen uptake [o2max] and 6 min at 70\% o2max). Two tests were undertaken to assess the reproducibility of scores that were obtained with each subjective scale. Two other tests were undertaken to assess the sensitivity of each scale to a change in symptom perception: a double-blind treatment with propranolol, 80 mg, (ie, active therapy; to increase the sensation of breathlessness and general fatigue during exercise) or matching placebo. The subjective scale scores were measured at 1 min 30 s, 5 min 30 s, and 7 min 15 s of exercise. Reproducibility was defined as the proportion of total variance (ie, between-subject plus within-subject variance) explained by the between-subject variance given as a percentage. Sensitivity was defined as the effect of the active drug therapy over the variation within subjects.
Results
Overall, the VAS performed best in terms of reproducibility for breathlessness and general fatigue, with reproducibility coefficients as high as 78\%. For sensitivity, the VAS was best for breathlessness (ratio, 2.7) and the Borg scale was most sensitive for general fatigue (ratio, 3.0). The relationships between the respective psychological and physiologic variables were reasonably stable throughout the testing procedure, with overall typical correlations of 0.73 to 0.82
Conclusion
This study suggests that subjective scales can reproducibly measure symptoms during steady-state exercise and can detect the effect of a drug intervention. The VAS and Borg scales appear to be the best subjective scales for this purpose.},

Formulas are found for the maxmum rate of transmission of binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of noise. Some of the properties of "ideal" systems which transmit at this maxmum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second for certain information sources is calculated.},

This chapter focuses on the design and integration of the cockpit-crew systems. A change in crew systems design philosophies, technologies, and cockpit layouts have begun in recent years. Several factors have been influential in causing that change. Probably the most important was the rapid rate at which advanced technologies applicable to crew systems were becoming available. The engineering community saw the advantages of incorporating new technologies—particularly in the area of avionics—for purposes of saving weight and space, while at the same time increasing reliability and supportability. Crew systems designers were, therefore, able to begin modernizing flight stations and were even encouraged by other design disciplines to incorporate new technology crew systems such as CRTs; integrated control-displays for communications, navigation, and transponders; and digital color weather radars. At the same time, operators of larger civil and military aircraft perceived large cost savings in salaries, personnel benefits, on-board equipment, and operating weight for each crew member that could be eliminated from the cockpit crew. To deal with problems, crew systems design teams have been organized at almost all of the major airframe manufacturers. Meanwhile, advances in avionics technology, particularly in computing capacity and data buses, permit integration of aircraft systems and functions in ways that were heretofore impossible or impractical. Future aircraft will be truly integrated systems. Applying artificial intelligence through expert systems will undoubtedly have far-reaching effects on crew systems of the future.},

This chapter serves as a starting point that both highlights significant issues as well as identifies practical aspects of crew station design and integration. Clearly, crew station design and integration is not a standalone effort, nor is it a final check on human performance after the rest of the system is designed. It is also not simplistic or linear. The first step is the recognition that the crew is an integral part of the larger system. When done well, it considers the crew in all aspects and phases of system design through an iterative and cyclical process. It involves a series of trade-offs and decisions achieved through analysis, test, evaluation and demonstration. In the end, it is about good business and good engineering. Three themes emerge from this chapter. The first is a historical context of the last 30 years of crew station evolution representing first commercial and then military crew stations. A second theme revolves around the issues that significantly impact crew station design. It focuses specifically on competing constraints and on the growth of information management and integration complexity. Finally, the third theme is a discussion of tools and methods for design and integration.},

	abstract = {NASA-TLX is a multi-dimensional scale designed to obtain workload estimates from one or more operators while they are performing a task or immediately afterwards. The years of research that preceded subscale selection and the weighted averaging approach resulted in a tool that has proven to be reasonably easy to use and reliably sensitive to experimentally important manipulations over the past 20 years. Its use has spread far beyond its original application (aviation), focus (crew complement), and language (English). This survey of 550 studies in which NASA-TLX was used or reviewed was undertaken to provide a resource for a new generation of users. The goal was to summarize the environments in which it has been applied, the types of activities the raters performed, other variables that were measured that did (or did not) covary, methodological issues, and lessons learned},
